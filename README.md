# React-Redux-Webpack-ES6-Boilerplate
Starter kit for React and Redux with Webpack in ES6

## NodeJS version (6.10.2)
We are using NodeJS Version 6.10.2. If your vesion is old then install nvm with version 6.10.2 and then run

```nvm use```

## Yarn (A new NPM)
We are using yarn instead of npm to install the dependecies. This is not an attempt to replace npm completely. Yarn is only a new CLI client that fetches modules from the npm registry. Nothing about the registry itself will change — you’ll still be able to fetch and publish packages as normal.
